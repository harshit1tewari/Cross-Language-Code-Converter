# For this simplified version, the AST is already quite universal.
# A transformer could be used for more complex language-specific AST manipulations
# before generation, e.g., converting complex Python comprehensions to loops
# if the target language doesn't support them directly.

# For now, this can be a pass-through or identity transformer.
